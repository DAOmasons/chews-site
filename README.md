## Overview

Chews Protocol is a modular Token Curated Registry (TCR) voting protocol that allows developers to create custom voting systems by composing different module types. Unlike traditional monolithic TCR systems that follow a one-size-fits-all approach, Chews ("choose") enables flexible and use-case-driven governance through its modular architecture.

The protocol can be thought of as an "ACR" (Anything Curated Registry) system, as it allows curation of registries based on any criteria, not just tokens. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of decision-making and governance applications.
